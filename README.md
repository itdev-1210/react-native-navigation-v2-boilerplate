**NOTE:** If you want to use [react-navigation-v3](https://reactnavigation.org/docs/en/getting-started.html) instead. Then you should use this one: [react-native-redux-navigation-v3-boilerplate](https://github.com/jayzyaj/react-native-redux-navigation-v3-boilerplate)

A **React Native** starter kit or boilerplate for starting a project with the help of **redux** for state management, **react-native elements** and **nativebase** for building the UI components and **react-navigation-v2** for the routing or navigation.

The project was bootstrapped with <a href="https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started" target="_blank">react-native init</a>

**List of used other libraries used aside from react-native**

1. For state management:
   - [Redux](https://github.com/reduxjs/redux)
   - [React Redux](https://github.com/reduxjs/react-redux)
   - [Redux Thunk](https://github.com/reduxjs/redux-thunk)
   - [Redux logger](https://github.com/LogRocket/redux-logger)
2. For UI components:
   - [React Native Elements](https://github.com/react-native-training/react-native-elements)
   - [NativeBase](https://github.com/GeekyAnts/NativeBase)
   - [React Native Vector Icons](https://github.com/oblador/react-native-vector-icons)
3. For navigation:
   - [React Navigation v2](https://reactnavigation.org/blog/2018/05/07/react-navigation-2.0.html)

### Installation

1. Clone the project repository `https://github.com/jayzyaj/react-native-with-redux-react-navigation-v2-boilerplate`

2. Go inside to the project directory that you have cloned and open the terminal or command line and run `npm -i` or `yarn install` to install all the package needed

3. To link all the libraries and dependencies run `react-native link`

### Usage

If you are using android run the command below

```
react-native run-android
```

and if you are using iOS

```
react-native run-ios
```
When you run the app it will show you a **SplashScreen** and it will dispatch a action to restore a session. If a session exist in the storage it will dispatch another action to authenticate the user and redirect it to the **HomeScreen** or the DrawerNavigator which is the authenticated route or stack. Otherwise if a session session does not exist it will return the **LoginScreen** or the StackNavigator which is the Unauthenticated route or stack.

In order to navigate to the **HomeScreen** you need to be authenticated or to sign in. Use the credentials below to sign in:

**email:** `test123@nomail.com`

**password:** `123456`
